# Cairo-Auth: Comprehensive Project Execution Guide üöÄ

Welcome to the Cairo-Auth project! Before diving deep into the code and execution, it's pivotal to have the right environment and prerequisites in place. This comprehensive guide is designed to facilitate a smooth setup and execution process, ensuring you face minimal roadblocks.

For a broader overview of the Cairo language, refer to the official documentation: [CairoZero Documentation](https://docs.cairo-lang.org/0.12.0/hello_cairo/index.html).

## üß© Prerequisites

### 1. **Python Environment**:
   - It's strongly recommended to utilize `pyenv` for managing multiple Python versions. When using `pyenv`, the Python version dictated by the `.python-version` file will be automatically selected.
   - If you choose not to use `pyenv`, ensure that your system has `Python 3.9.17` installed.

## üõ† Initial Setup

### **Step 1:** Setting up a Python virtual environment
```shell
python -m venv .venv
```

### **Step 2:** Activating the virtual environment

For Unix or MacOS systems:
```shell
source .venv/bin/activate
```
For Windows systems:
```shell
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **Step 3:** Installing the necessary Python packages
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **Step 4:** Compilation of CairoZero code
```shell
./scripts/1-compile.sh
```

### **Step 5:** Execution of the CairoZero program to generate a trace
```shell
./scripts/2-run.sh
```

### **Step 6:** Generation of a CairoZero proof using the trace
```shell
./scripts/3-prove.sh
```

### **Step 7:** Verification of the generated proof
```shell
./scripts/4-verify.sh
```

## üåê Minikube Environment Setup

### **Step 1:** DNS Configuration for Minikube 

Ensure that the Minikube DNS environment is set up on your machine to expose ingress hostnames. For detailed steps, consult the official documentation: [Minikube Ingress DNS Guide](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/addons/ingress-dns/).

### **Step 2:** DNS server configuration

Update the `systemd-resolved` configuration to point to `127.0.0.1` as your primary DNS server. This can be done by editing the `resolved.conf` file.

#### `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf`:
```
DNS=127.0.0.1
```

### **Step 3:** Initiating Minikube with necessary add-ons
```shell
minikube start --addons ingress,ingress-dns
```

### **Step 4:** Installation of cert-manager in the cluster
```shell
kubectl apply -f https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.12.4/cert-manager.yaml
```

### **Step 5:** Deployment of the server application
```shell
skaffold run
```

### **Step 6:** Accessing the Application

Launch your preferred browser and navigate to the domain specified in the ingress. An example could be:
```
https://cairo.test/
```
